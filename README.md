## Pre-requisites
- **Python**: Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download the latest version of Python from the official Python website: python.org

- **Java**: Make sure you have Java installed on your machine. You can get the latest version from Java website: java.com

- **Package Manager**: Install a package manager like pip or conda. Pip is the default package manager for Python and is usually pre-installed with Python. Conda is an alternative package manager that is often used for managing Python environments. You can install conda by downloading Anaconda or Miniconda from their respective websites.

- **Virtual Environment (optional)**: It is recommended to set up a virtual environment for your Python project. Virtual environments allow you to isolate project dependencies and avoid conflicts between different projects. You can create a virtual environment using tools like venv, virtualenv, or conda.

- **Data Pipelines**: Some knowledge of Data Engineering and Data Pipelining concepts. On top of that, familarity with Mage Data would be beneficial
